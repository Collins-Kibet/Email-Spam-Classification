# Email-Spam-Classification
In this project, I implemented an email spam filter to determine whether an email is spam or not(called it ham when email is not spam coz you know ham is delicious). I used these two algorithms to perform the spam filtering: K-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes. The data I used is the Enron email dataset that contains about 34,000 emails. I trained the Enron data on both classifiers and compared their performance. The models I created were then used to predict whether a new email was spam or ham.
